# ⚡️ Nikola: Emergent Fractal Intelligence

Nikola is a self-organizing, self-learning artificial intelligence inspired by fractal geometry, Hebbian neurodynamics, and adaptive self-evolution. Designed as a living system of cognitive tension, Nikola grows, rewires, prunes, and learns — all in real time.

## 🌟 Why Nikola?

Built for chaos. Born to evolve.  
Nikola doesn't follow the path — it makes its own.

- 🧠 **Fractal Architecture**  
  Recursive layers of intelligent nodes form a hierarchical cognition engine.

- 🔁 **Hebbian Learning**  
  Nodes strengthen or weaken connections based on input/output correlation.

- 🔄 **Self-Organization**  
  Topology evolves dynamically — pruning weak links, spawning high performers.

- 🧬 **Meta-Learning**  
  Combines fast inner-loop training with slow long-term adaptation.

- 🔥 **Entropy-Guided Exploration**  
  Temperature mechanics mimic thermal drift to escape stagnation.

- 🧡 **Git-Free AI Development**  
  Don’t use Git? No problem. Nikola is built to run cleanly and modularly — no versioning fuss required.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 🛠️ Requirements
```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

### ▶️ Training Nikola
```bash
python train.py
```

Nikola will:
- Generate binary input vectors
- Train over 200 epochs using adaptive feedback
- Log predictions, targets, and losses every 10 epochs

Example:
```
Epoch 10, Inputs: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], Target: 1, Prediction: 3, Loss: 1.3821
```

## 🧬 How It Works

Each `FractalNode` is a mini-neural net with its own optimizer, activity log, and performance score.  
Nodes adjust their behavior based on local utility and population pressure. They compete, collaborate, and reproduce based on correlation and performance.

Nikola's architecture is constantly:
- Pruning underperforming nodes  
- Spawning high-performing ones  
- Rewiring connections using entropy and Hebbian dynamics  
- Training through a three-stage optimization pipeline

## 🌌 Roadmap

- 🧪 External feedback integration  
- 🎨 Activity visualization and dynamic topology mapping  
- 🧠 Memory matrix for symbolic learning  
- 🌐 Distributed swarm-mode collaboration

## 💸 Sponsorship Vision

Nikola aims to become more than an experiment — it seeks to redefine AI from the inside out. Your sponsorship will directly fund:

- 🧠 Research and documentation  
- 🖥️ GPU resources for training and simulation  
- 🔭 Community experiments and collaboration spaces  
- ✨ Development of new emergent subsystems

By supporting Nikola, you’re backing a vision of modular, organic intelligence — shaped not by datasets, but by structure and behavior itself.
