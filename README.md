# Nikola: A Fractal Emergent AI Framework

Nikola isn’t just a neural network. It’s a living architecture.  
It prunes. It replicates. It rewires. It evolves.  
Inspired by nature. Built for emergence. Powered by entropy.

## 🧠 What Is Nikola?

**Nikola** is an experimental AI system with a recursive, self-modifying fractal topology. Each node adapts via Hebbian learning, reorganizes its connections based on entropy-weighted scores, and engages in meta-training across layers. The architecture simulates **neuroplasticity**, **structural evolution**, and **adaptive cognition**.

It’s not static.  
It’s synthetic intelligence in motion.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🌌 **Fractal Layering** — Nodes grow `2^n` per level, enabling recursive signal flow.
- 🔁 **Self-Organization** — Connections update through entropy and performance heuristics.
- 🧠 **Hebbian Learning** — Correlation-driven weight updates at every node.
- ⚡ **Meta-Gradient Training** — Multi-pass gradient descent mimics fast weights / MAML.
- 🧬 **Structural Evolution** — Nodes prune themselves. High performers spawn progeny.
- 🔧 **Modular Design** — Clear separation across `node.py`, `topology.py`, `helpers.py`, `config.yaml`.

## 🧪 Example Behavior

> Watch as nodes prune themselves when activity wanes.  
> Observe high-performing neurons replicate under entropy thresholds.  
> Feel the network reorganize itself in response to input patterns.

Training logs show predictions, targets, and loss—offering a window into the mind’s synthetic unfolding.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Nikola plays on the edge of chaos.  
It mixes neuroscience metaphors with practical ML tooling.  
This is a sandbox for emergent AI research.  
An experiment in artificial evolution.  
A glimpse into systems that build themselves.

Whether you're an engineer, researcher, tinkerer, or futurist—Nikola invites you to shape the next phase of machine intelligence.

## 🤝 GitHub Sponsors

This project is actively seeking support to push boundaries:

- Help scale the system to multi-agent scenarios.
- Support visualization tools for live network tracking.
- Fund deeper research into synthetic neuroplasticity.
- Or simply **sponsor a node**—keep it learning.

Let’s build minds that grow.
