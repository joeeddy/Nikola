# Nikola: A Fractal Emergent AI Framework

Nikola is a self-organizing, self-learning neural system inspired by fractal geometry, Hebbian plasticity, and meta-gradient evolution. It learns, rewires, grows, and prunes itself—emulating organic intelligence through synthetic architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌌 Fractal network structure with recursive hierarchy
- 🧠 Hebbian learning with activity-driven pruning and replication
- 🔁 Self-organization through entropy-weighted rewiring
- ⚡ Meta-training via multi-stage gradient descent
- 🔧 Modular architecture with YAML-configurable hyperparameters
